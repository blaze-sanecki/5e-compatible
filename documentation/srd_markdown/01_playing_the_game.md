## Exceptions Supersede General Rules

General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn't explicitly say otherwise.

The game also includes elements -- class features, feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like -- that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.

## Round Down

Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make an exception and tell you to round up.

---

## Rhythm of Play

The three main pillars of D&D play are social interaction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one you're experiencing, the game unfolds according to this basic pattern:

**1: The Game Master Describes a Scene.** The GM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, and so on).

**2: The Players Describe What Their Characters Do.** Typically, the characters stick together as they travel through a dungeon or another environment. Sometimes different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the GM ensures that every character has a chance to act and decides how to resolve their activity. In combat, the characters take turns.

**3: The GM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers' Actions.** Sometimes resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to open a door, the GM might say the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the GM might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the game back to step 1.

This pattern holds during every game session (each time you sit down to play D&D), whether the adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a dragon. In certain situations -- particularly combat -- the action is more structured, and everyone takes turns.

## The Six Abilities

All creatures -- characters and monsters -- have six abilities that measure physical and mental characteristics, as shown on the Ability Descriptions table.

### Ability Descriptions

| Ability | Score Measures |
|---|---|
| Strength | Physical might |
| Dexterity | Agility, reflexes, and balance |
| Constitution | Health and stamina |
| Intelligence | Reasoning and memory |
| Wisdom | Perceptiveness and mental fortitude |
| Charisma | Confidence, poise, and charm |

### Ability Scores

Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some monsters have a score as high as 30. The score represents the magnitude of an ability.

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 1 | This is the lowest a score can normally go. If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens. |
| 2--9 | This represents a weak capability. |
| 10--11 | This represents the human average. |
| 12--19 | This represents a strong capability. |
| 20 | This is the highest an adventurer's score can go unless a feature says otherwise. |
| 21--29 | This represents an extraordinary capability. |
| 30 | This is the highest a score can go. |

### Ability Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a D20 Test with that ability. An ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the following table.

| Score | Modifier |
|---|---|
| 1 | -5 |
| 2--3 | -4 |
| 4--5 | -3 |
| 6--7 | -2 |
| 8--9 | -1 |
| 10--11 | +0 |
| 12--13 | +1 |
| 14--15 | +2 |
| 16--17 | +3 |
| 18--19 | +4 |
| 20--21 | +5 |
| 22--23 | +6 |
| 24--25 | +7 |
| 26--27 | +8 |
| 28--29 | +9 |
| 30 | +10 |

---

## D20 Tests

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game uses a d20 roll to determine success or failure. These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. They follow these steps:

**1: Roll 1d20.** You always want to roll high. If the roll has Advantage or Disadvantage (described later), you roll two d20s, but you use the number from only one of them -- the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower one if you have Disadvantage.

**2: Add Modifiers.** Add these modifiers to the number rolled on the d20:

- **The Relevant Ability Modifier.** This chapter and the rules glossary explain which ability modifier to use for various D20 Tests.
- **Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant.** Each creature has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added when making a D20 Test that uses something, such as a skill, in which the creature has proficiency.
- **Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties.** A class feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus or penalty to the die roll.

**3: Compare the Total to a Target Number.** If the total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or exceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).

### Ability Checks

An ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge. The GM and the rules often call for an ability check when a creature attempts something other than an attack that has a chance of meaningful failure.

#### Ability Check Examples

| Ability | Make a Check To... |
|---|---|
| Strength | Lift, push, pull, or break something |
| Dexterity | Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly |
| Constitution | Push your body beyond normal limits |
| Intelligence | Reason or remember |
| Wisdom | Notice things in the environment or in creatures' behavior |
| Charisma | Influence, entertain, or deceive |

**Proficiency Bonus.** Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check when the GM determines that a skill or tool proficiency is relevant to the check and you have that proficiency.

#### Typical Difficulty Classes

| Task Difficulty | DC |
|---|---|
| Very easy | 5 |
| Easy | 10 |
| Medium | 15 |
| Hard | 20 |
| Very hard | 25 |
| Nearly impossible | 30 |

### Saving Throws

A saving throw represents an attempt to evade or resist a threat. You don't normally choose to make a save; you must make one because your character or a monster is at risk. If you don't want to resist the effect, you can choose to fail the save without rolling.

#### Saving Throw Examples

| Ability | Make a Save To... |
|---|---|
| Strength | Physically resist direct force |
| Dexterity | Dodge out of harm's way |
| Constitution | Endure a toxic hazard |
| Intelligence | Recognize an illusion as fake |
| Wisdom | Resist a mental assault |
| Charisma | Assert your identity |

### Attack Rolls

An attack roll determines whether an attack hits a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class.

#### Attack Roll Abilities

| Ability | Attack Type |
|---|---|
| Strength | Melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike |
| Dexterity | Ranged attack with a weapon |
| Varies | Spell attack (determined by spellcasting feature) |

### Armor Class

A creature's base Armor Class (AC) is calculated as follows:

**Base AC** = 10 + the creature's Dexterity modifier.

AC can be modified by armor, magic items, spells, and more. Only one base AC calculation can be in effect for a creature at a time.

### Rolling 20 or 1

**Natural 20 on an Attack Roll.** If you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, the attack is a Critical Hit and automatically hits regardless of the target's AC.

**Natural 1 on an Attack Roll.** If you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, the attack always misses regardless of modifiers.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

**Advantage.** Roll two d20s and use the higher roll.

**Disadvantage.** Roll two d20s and use the lower roll.

**They Don't Stack.** Multiple sources of Advantage still mean you roll only two d20s. The same is true for multiple sources of Disadvantage.

**They Cancel Each Other.** If you have both Advantage and Disadvantage on a roll, they cancel each other out regardless of how many sources of each you have, and you roll a single d20.

**Interactions with Rerolls.** When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and something in the game lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the dice, not both.

> ### Heroic Inspiration
>
> Sometimes the GM or a rule gives you **Heroic Inspiration**. If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new roll.
>
> **Only One at a Time.** You can never have more than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something would give it to you and you already have it, you can give it to another player character who lacks it.
>
> **Gaining Heroic Inspiration.** The GM can award Heroic Inspiration to a player character for heroic, in-character, or otherwise entertaining actions. Human characters start each day with Heroic Inspiration.

---

## Proficiency

Characters and monsters each have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact of training on the creature's capabilities.

### Proficiency Bonus

| Level or CR | Bonus |
|---|---|
| Up to 4 | +2 |
| 5--8 | +3 |
| 9--12 | +4 |
| 13--16 | +5 |
| 17--20 | +6 |
| 21--24 | +7 |
| 25--28 | +8 |
| 29--30 | +9 |

**The Bonus Doesn't Stack.** Your Proficiency Bonus can't be added to a die roll or another number more than once. Occasionally your Proficiency Bonus may be multiplied or divided (for example, the Expertise feature doubles it), but the bonus is applied only once, even in those cases.

### Skill Proficiencies

Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an ability check. If you have proficiency in a skill, you add your Proficiency Bonus when you make an ability check associated with that skill. Without proficiency, you make the ability check without the bonus.

#### Skills

| Skill | Ability | Example Uses |
|---|---|---|
| Acrobatics | Dexterity | Stay on your feet in a tricky situation, or perform an acrobatic stunt. |
| Animal Handling | Wisdom | Calm or train an animal, or get an animal to behave in a certain way. |
| Arcana | Intelligence | Recall lore about spells, magic items, and the planes of existence. |
| Athletics | Strength | Jump farther than normal, stay afloat in rough water, or break something. |
| Deception | Charisma | Tell a convincing lie, or wear a disguise convincingly. |
| History | Intelligence | Recall lore about historical events, people, nations, and cultures. |
| Insight | Wisdom | Discern a person's mood and intentions. |
| Intimidation | Charisma | Awe or threaten someone into doing what you want. |
| Investigation | Intelligence | Find obscure information in books, or deduce how something works. |
| Medicine | Wisdom | Diagnose an illness, or determine what killed the recently slain. |
| Nature | Intelligence | Recall lore about terrain, plants, animals, and weather. |
| Perception | Wisdom | Using a combination of senses, notice something that's easy to miss. |
| Performance | Charisma | Act, tell a story, perform music, or dance. |
| Persuasion | Charisma | Honestly and graciously convince someone of something. |
| Religion | Intelligence | Recall lore about gods, religious rituals, and holy symbols. |
| Sleight of Hand | Dexterity | Pick a pocket, conceal a handheld object, or perform legerdemain. |
| Stealth | Dexterity | Escape notice by moving quietly and hiding behind things. |
| Survival | Wisdom | Follow tracks, forage, find a trail, or avoid natural hazards. |

### Saving Throw Proficiencies

Saving throw proficiency lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to saves using a particular ability. Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws.

### Equipment Proficiencies

**Weapons.** Anyone can wield a weapon, but proficiency adds your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls you make with a weapon in which you are proficient.

**Tools.** Proficiency with a tool adds your Proficiency Bonus to ability checks you make using that tool. If you are also proficient in the skill used with the check, you have Advantage on the check.

## Actions

On your turn, you can take one of the following actions. Additional actions may be granted by class features, spells, or other rules.

| Action | Summary |
|---|---|
| Attack | Attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike. |
| Dash | For the rest of the turn, give yourself extra movement equal to your Speed. |
| Disengage | Your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn. |
| Dodge | Until the start of your next turn, attack rolls against you have Disadvantage, and you make Dexterity saving throws with Advantage. You lose this benefit if you have the Incapacitated condition or if your Speed is 0. |
| Help | Help another creature's ability check or attack roll, or administer first aid. |
| Hide | Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. |
| Influence | Make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to alter a creature's attitude. |
| Magic | Cast a spell, use a magic item, or use a magical feature. |
| Ready | Prepare to take an action in response to a trigger you define. |
| Search | Make a Wisdom (Insight, Medicine, Perception, or Survival) check. |
| Study | Make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion) check. |
| Utilize | Use a nonmagical object. |

**One Thing at a Time.** You can take only one action at a time. If a feature allows multiple options, you choose one each time you use it.

### Bonus Actions

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability, spell, or feature states that you can do something as a Bonus Action. You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn.

### Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a Reaction. A Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. You get one Reaction per round, which resets at the start of your next turn.

---

## Social Interaction

NPCs have attitudes toward player characters that influence interactions:

- **Friendly.** A Friendly creature is positively disposed toward the characters.
- **Indifferent.** An Indifferent creature has no particular inclination to help or hinder.
- **Hostile.** A Hostile creature is opposed to the characters.

Interactions progress through roleplaying and ability checks, with the Influence action being central to shifting NPC attitudes.

---

## Exploration

Adventuring equipment -- such as ladders, torches, rope, and thieves' tools -- facilitates exploration.

### Vision and Light

The presence or absence of light determines the category of visibility in an area.

**Lightly Obscured.** An area of dim light, patchy fog, or similar conditions is Lightly Obscured. Creatures have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight in a Lightly Obscured area.

**Heavily Obscured.** An area of darkness, heavy fog, or similar conditions is Heavily Obscured. A creature in a Heavily Obscured area effectively has the Blinded condition.

#### Light Sources

**Bright Light.** Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim Light.** Dim light, also called shadows, creates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light (such as a torch) and surrounding darkness.

**Darkness.** Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical darkness.

#### Special Senses

Some creatures have special senses that help them perceive things in certain situations:

- **Blindsight.** A creature with Blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.
- **Darkvision.** A creature with Darkvision can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, within a specific radius. The creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
- **Tremorsense.** A creature with Tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the creature and the source of vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance.
- **Truesight.** A creature with Truesight can see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature transformed by magic, all within a specific range.

### Hiding

To try to hide, you take the Hide action. The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check and note the result. Until you are discovered or stop hiding, that total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for you.

### Interacting with Objects

Objects are discrete, inanimate items -- such as weapons, chairs, tables, and doors -- that the world contains.

**In Combat.** You can interact freely with one object or feature of the environment during your turn (such as opening a door or drawing a weapon). Interacting with additional objects requires the Utilize action.

**Finding Hidden Objects.** When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Carrying Objects.** In most cases, you need not worry about the weight of what you carry. If you try to carry an unusually heavy load, the GM may require you to abide by the carrying capacity rules in the rules glossary.

**Breaking Objects.** As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper.

### Hazards

Dangerous environmental conditions and events can threaten adventurers:

- **Burning.** A creature or object on fire takes damage at the start of each turn until the fire is extinguished.
- **Dehydration.** A creature requires water each day or risks exhaustion.
- **Falling.** A creature takes 1d6 Bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it falls, to a maximum of 20d6.
- **Malnutrition.** A creature requires food each day or risks exhaustion.
- **Suffocation.** A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When it runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round) before dropping to 0 Hit Points.

### Travel

When adventurers are traveling, the group chooses a pace as shown in the Travel Pace table.

#### Travel Pace

| Pace | Per Minute | Per Hour | Per Day |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fast | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles |
| Normal | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles |
| Slow | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles |

**Pace Effects:**

- **Fast.** Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks, and on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
- **Normal.** Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
- **Slow.** Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks.

**Marching Order.** While traveling, adventurers should establish a marching order, noting who is at the front and who is at the back of the group.

### Playing on a Grid

If you play out a combat using a square grid:

- **Squares.** Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.
- **Speed.** A creature's Speed, divided by 5, gives the number of squares it can move.
- **Difficult Terrain.** Each square of Difficult Terrain costs 2 squares of movement to enter.
- **Diagonal Movement.** Diagonal movement can't cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.

---

## Combat

### The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A **round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn** in Initiative order.

### Combat Step by Step

1. **Establish Positions.** The GM determines where all characters and monsters are located.
2. **Roll Initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiative (a Dexterity check), determining the order of combatants' turns.
3. **Take Turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 3 until the fighting stops.

### Initiative

At the start of a combat encounter, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the Initiative order.

- **Surprise.** If a combatant is surprised, that combatant has Disadvantage on their Initiative roll.
- **Ties.** The GM decides the order among tied monsters. Players decide the order among tied characters. The GM decides the order if a tie is between a monster and a character.

### Your Turn

On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your Speed and **take one action**. You decide the order of your moving and action-taking.

**Communicating.** You can communicate however you are able -- through brief utterances and gestures -- as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither your action nor your move.

**Interacting with Things.** You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or action. To interact with a second object, you need to take the Utilize action.

**Doing Nothing.** You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action.

### Ending Combat

Combat ends when one side is defeated -- whether killed, knocked out, surrendered, or fled -- or when both sides agree to stop fighting.

### Movement and Position

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your Speed. Your movement can include climbing, crawling, jumping, and swimming, each of which may have special rules.

**Difficult Terrain.** Moving through Difficult Terrain costs an extra foot of movement for every foot moved.

**Breaking Up Your Move.** You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your Speed before and after your action.

**Dropping Prone.** You can drop Prone without using any of your Speed. You can't drop Prone if your Speed is 0.

### Creature Size and Space

Each creature takes up a different amount of space depending on its size.

| Size | Space (Feet) | Space (Squares) |
|---|---|---|
| Tiny | 2.5 by 2.5 ft. | 4 per square |
| Small | 5 by 5 ft. | 1 square |
| Medium | 5 by 5 ft. | 1 square |
| Large | 10 by 10 ft. | 4 squares (2 by 2) |
| Huge | 15 by 15 ft. | 9 squares (3 by 3) |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. | 16 squares (4 by 4) |

**Moving around Other Creatures.** You can move through an ally's space, an Incapacitated creature's space, a Tiny creature's space, or the space of a creature that is two or more sizes larger or smaller than you. Another creature's space is Difficult Terrain for you unless the creature is Tiny or is your ally.

### Making an Attack

When you take the Attack action, you follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Target.** Pick a target within your attack's range.
2. **Determine Modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has cover, whether you have Advantage or Disadvantage against the target, and any other bonuses or penalties that apply.
3. **Resolve the Attack.** Make the attack roll. On a hit, roll damage.

#### Unseen Attackers and Targets

- **Can't See the Target.** When you attack a target you can't see, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll.
- **Target Can't See You.** If you are unseen by the target, you have Advantage on the attack roll.
- **Hidden Attacker's Location.** When a hidden creature makes an attack, the creature's location is revealed after the attack hits or misses.

#### Cover

| Degree | Benefit to Target | Offered By |
|---|---|---|
| Half | +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws | Another creature or an object that covers at least half the target |
| Three-Quarters | +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws | An object that covers at least three-quarters of the target |
| Total | Can't be targeted directly | An object that covers the whole target |

### Ranged Attacks

**Single Range.** You can't attack a target beyond the listed range.

**Two Ranges (Normal/Long).** You have Disadvantage on attack rolls when targeting beyond normal range. You can't attack a target beyond the long range.

**Ranged Attacks in Close Combat.** You have Disadvantage on ranged attack rolls when a hostile creature that can see you is within 5 feet of you.

### Melee Attacks

**Standard Reach.** Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can attack targets within 5 feet when making a melee attack.

**Opportunity Attacks.** When a creature you can see moves out of your reach, you can use your Reaction to make one melee attack against it. This is called an Opportunity Attack. You can avoid provoking Opportunity Attacks by taking the Disengage action, teleporting, or being moved by forced movement (such as being pushed by a spell).

### Mounted Combat

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount.

**Mounting and Dismounting.** During your move, you can mount or dismount a creature that is within 5 feet of you. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your Speed.

**Controlled Mount.** A controlled mount acts on your Initiative and can only take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action.

**Independent Mount.** An independent mount retains its own place in the Initiative order and acts normally.

**Falling Off.** If an effect threatens to knock you off your mount, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall Prone in a space within 5 feet of the mount.

### Underwater Combat

When making attacks while underwater:

- **Melee Attacks.** A creature that doesn't have a Swim Speed has Disadvantage on melee attack rolls unless the attack deals Piercing damage.
- **Ranged Attacks.** A ranged attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has Disadvantage.
- **Fire Resistance.** Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have Resistance to Fire damage.

---

## Damage and Healing

### Hit Points

Hit Points (HP) represent a creature's durability and will to live. A creature's current HP can decrease from its maximum down to 0. A creature is considered **Bloodied** when at half its Hit Point maximum or fewer.

### Damage Rolls

When an attack or effect deals damage, you roll the damage dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to the target. The minimum damage from any source is 0. When attacking, you add the same ability modifier used for the attack roll to the damage.

### Critical Hits

When you score a Critical Hit, you roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal (modifiers are added only once, not doubled).

### Saving Throws and Damage

- **Multiple Targets.** When you create a damaging effect that forces two or more targets to make saving throws against it at the same time, roll the damage once for all targets.
- **Half Damage.** Many saving throw effects deal half damage (rounded down) on a successful save.

### Damage Types

Different attacks and effects deal different types of damage:

**Acid** | **Bludgeoning** | **Cold** | **Fire** | **Force** | **Lightning** | **Necrotic** | **Piercing** | **Poison** | **Psychic** | **Radiant** | **Slashing** | **Thunder**

### Resistance and Vulnerability

**Resistance.** If a creature has Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it (rounded down).

**Vulnerability.** If a creature has Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

**No Stacking.** Multiple instances of Resistance or Vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance.

**Order of Application.** Apply any adjustments to damage first, then Resistance second, and Vulnerability third.

### Immunity

If a creature has Immunity to a damage type, damage of that type doesn't reduce its Hit Points. If a creature has Immunity to a condition, it isn't affected by that condition.

### Healing

Certain abilities, spells, and magic items can restore Hit Points to a creature through healing. A creature's current Hit Points can't exceed its Hit Point maximum.

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, one of the following occurs:

**Monster Death.** A monster dies instantly when it drops to 0 Hit Points. A GM may have a monster fall Unconscious instead, following the rules for player characters.

**HP Maximum of 0.** If a creature's Hit Point maximum is reduced to 0, the creature dies.

**Massive Damage.** When damage reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points and there is damage remaining, the creature dies if the remaining damage equals or exceeds its Hit Point maximum.

> ### Knocking Out a Creature
>
> When you reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can instead set the creature to 1 Hit Point and give it the Unconscious condition. This condition ends on the creature if it regains any Hit Points or if someone takes an action to administer first aid to it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The Unconscious condition also ends if the creature finishes a Short Rest.

### Falling Unconscious

If you drop to 0 Hit Points and don't die outright, you gain the Unconscious condition.

### Death Saving Throws

At the start of each of your turns while you have 0 Hit Points, you must make a special saving throw -- called a Death Saving Throw -- to determine whether you creep closer to death or cling to life.

- **Roll 1d20.** A result of 10 or higher is a success. Below 10 is a failure. Note successes and failures separately; they don't need to be consecutive.
- **Three Successes.** If you accumulate three successes, you become Stable (see below).
- **Three Failures.** If you accumulate three failures, you die.
- **Rolling 1.** A 1 on the d20 counts as two failures.
- **Rolling 20.** A 20 on the d20 means you regain 1 Hit Point.
- **Damage at 0 Hit Points.** If you take damage while at 0 Hit Points, you suffer one Death Saving Throw failure (two failures if the damage is from a Critical Hit). If the damage equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.

### Stabilizing a Character

You can use the Help action to try to stabilize a creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. A Stable creature doesn't make Death Saving Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points. If it takes damage again, the creature becomes unstable and must resume making Death Saving Throws. A Stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.

### Temporary Hit Points

Some spells and other effects grant Temporary Hit Points to a creature.

- **Lost Before Real HP.** Temporary Hit Points are lost before real Hit Points when you take damage.
- **Duration.** Temporary Hit Points last until they are depleted or you finish a Long Rest.
- **Don't Stack.** Temporary Hit Points don't stack. If you receive Temporary Hit Points while you already have some, you choose which to keep.
- **Not Real HP.** Temporary Hit Points are not real Hit Points; receiving them doesn't count as healing and can't restore an Unconscious creature to consciousness.

---

## Resting

Adventurers can take rests in the midst of adventuring to restore their energy and abilities.

**Short Rest.** A Short Rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

**Long Rest.** A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity. A main benefit of both types of rest is the opportunity to regain Hit Points. Full rules for Short Rests and Long Rests can be found in the Rules Glossary.
